L2W (Linux to Windows)

Description:
L2W maps familiar Linux commands to their Windows equivalents.
You enter a Linux command, and the script executes the corresponding Windows command.
Arguments (flags) correspond to Windows syntax â€” full support for Linux flags is not implemented,
as this would require a full-fledged emulator. This tool is intended for entertainment purposes only.

Usage
1. Run L2W.bat
2. Enter Linux commands in the window that appears 
3. To display the available commands, enter: help

Supported commands
ls, pwd, cd, clear, cat, touch, mkdir, rmdir, rm, mv, cp, tree, stat, find, findstr,
echo, whoami, hostname, ver, date, time, shutdown, reboot, logout, tasklist, taskkill,
chdir, attrib, fc, comp, type, more, pause, set, systeminfo, sc, sfc, chkntfs, chkdsk,
diskpart, label, path, prompt, title, help, tar, icacls, cacls, ip addr, ping,
traceroute, netstat, route

Notes
Does not support flags for Linux
